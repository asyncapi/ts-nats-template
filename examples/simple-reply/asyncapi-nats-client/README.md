<p align="center">
  <em>This is a generated TypeScript/Node.js NATS client for the application - Reply example with streetlight.</em>
</p>

**We highly recommend you do not modify this client in any way since it is build for you to re-generate it when your AsyncAPI document changes.** 



You can find the general information about the different aspects of this library by checking [the documentation folder](./docs/general.md).

An [API document](./API.md) have also been generated which contains all the possible configurations and usages this client supports.

## Example
```ts
import * as GeneratedClient from "./nats-client";
const natsClient = new GeneratedClient.NatsAsyncApiClient();
natsClient.connect(...).catch((e) => {});
```
